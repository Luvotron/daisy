Daisy speech queue reader:
Reads from tosay/ folder, text files in order of importance and time
Files in tosay/ are prepended by a # (lower is more important)
ex: tosay/001-2015-03-14-143001-printcomplete.txt
(important msg, print complete on 3/14/2015 at 2:30:01pm)
If time stamp is older than current time by more than a few minutes,
state the time it happened.
Then moves them to said/folder or log file

TODO:
    -Turn this into a daemon that dies with main process
    -Using 3 digit prefix on textfile names, decide whether to read
and archive immediately or to keep in queue until attention has been confirmed.
Also, provide a way to confirm things, or in effect ask questions of particular
household members.
    -Check to see if talking is allowed at present time.
        -Hold queue until it is and add "At blah blah, this happened..."
        -Add "at blah blah, this happened" to english.yaml
